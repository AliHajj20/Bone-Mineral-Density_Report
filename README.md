# Bone-Mineral-Density_Report
The Bone Mineral Density Study is a longitudinal investigation designed to identify risk factors associated with osteoporosis. 
The dataset includes information from 10,000 individuals. 
This project aims to analyze the data using appropriate statistical and computational methods to determine the key predictors influencing bone mineral density (BMD) and contributing to osteoporosis risk.
